# Energiverse: AI-Powered Decentralized Energy Marketplace System

## Overview
Energiverse is a decentralized platform that combines **blockchain** and **AI forecasting** for secure and intelligent energy trading.  
Users can trade electricity transparently, while AI models predict energy demand for smarter decision-making.

## Key Features
- Blockchain smart contract for secure energy exchange  
- AI model (Prophet + XGBoost) for 48-hour energy demand forecasting  
- Web dashboard with charts and analytics  
- Integration with MetaMask for wallet-based access  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web3.js, Chart.js  
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Remix IDE  
- **AI Model:** Python, Prophet, XGBoost, NumPy, Scikit-learn  

## How It Works
1. **Frontend:** User logs in, connects wallet, and interacts with the marketplace  
2. **Smart Contract:** Manages listing, buying, and withdrawing energy  
3. **AI Model:** Forecasts energy demand and exports results for frontend visualization  

## Setup
- Install Node.js, Python 3.8+, VS Code  
- Run frontend with Live Server  
- Deploy smart contract via Remix IDE (testnet: Sepolia)  
- Generate forecasts by running `ai_model.py`
